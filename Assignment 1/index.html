        <p>Hi! My name is Jackson Weist and I am a second year at the University of Cincinnati. I am double majoring in Electronic Media at CCM as well as Communication through A&S. I chose the background color to be light grey because it is my favorite color, and I'm glad it does not make the text too hard to read. I don't have any pictures of myself on hand on this computer, so the image I chose is a picture I took of the Ohio River that I like. </p>
